It is highly recommended that you download and use Gitkraken to make working with the git-flow model as frictionless as possible. Please refer any questions to Drake for getting it set up. You can download the application for free here:

https://www.gitkraken.com/

If you do not want to use Gitkraken, then please make sure that you are doing all of your work in the develop branch or in a feature branch. Please refer to Drake for all merges. Do not commit directly to master, because Netlify will be set up to trigger builds based on whenever a commit is made to the master branch.

Whenever the application builds, it will be deployed to this address:
